/* 
Write a function `countsBs` that takes a string as its only argument
and returns a number that indicates and returns a number that indicates
how many uppercase "B" characters are in the string.

Next write a function called `countChar` that behaves like `countsBs`,
except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that
is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters).
Rewrite `countBs` to make use of this new function.

// Your code here.

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4
