# CHAPTER 2: PROGRAM STRUCTURE

This chapter expands beyond nouns and sentence fragments of JS language.

## EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS

In C1, we declared values, and the applied operators to these values to
generate new values. Creating values is the main substance of any JS
program. But that substance has to be framed in a larger structure to be
useful. So that's what we'll cover next.

A fragment of code that produces a value is called an _expression_. Every
value that is written literally (such as `22` or `"pscyhoanalysis"`) is 
an expression.
