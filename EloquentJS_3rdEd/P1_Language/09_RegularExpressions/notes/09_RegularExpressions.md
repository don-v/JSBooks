# REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

"Some people, when confronted with a prolem, thik 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now 
they have two problem." -- James Zawinski

"When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength is needed. When you program 
against the grain of the problem, much code is needed." -- Maser Yuan-Ma, *The Book of Programming*

Programming tools and techniques survive and spread in a chaotic, evolutionary way. It's not always 
the best or most brilliant ones that win, but rather the ones that function well enough within 
the right niche or that happen to be integrated with another successful piece of technology. 

In this chapter, teach will discuss one such tool, *regular expressions*. Regular expressions 
are a way to describe patterns in string data. They form a small, separate language that is part 
of JS and many other languages and systems. 

Regular expressions are both terribly awkward and extremely useful. Their syntax is cryptic 
and the programming interface JS provides for them is clumsy. But they are a powerful tool for 
inspecting and processing strings. Properly understanding regular expressions will make you a more 
effective programmer.
