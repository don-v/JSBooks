# C4: DATA STRUCTURES: OBJECTS AND ARRAYS

Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are
built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though.
_Objects_ allow us to group values -- including other objects -- to build
more complex structures.

The programs we built so far have been limited by the fact that they
were operating only on simple data types. This chapter will introduce
basic data structures. By the end of it, one'll know enough to start
writing useful programs.

The chapter will work through a more or less realistic programming
example, introducing concepts as tehy apply to the problem at hand.
The example code will often build on functions and bindings that
were introduced earlier in the text.

## THE WERESQUIRREL

Jacques turns into a squirrel and that causes problems. He wants to figure
out why this happens and so he collects data so he can later study 
the data to figure out why the transformations occur. Data structures
allow him to store this information.
