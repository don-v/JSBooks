/* 
Earlier in the chapter teach mentioned that an object's `hasOwnProperty` can be used as 
a more robust alternative to the `in` operator when one wants to ignore the prototype's
properties. But what if one's map needs to include the word `"hasOwnProperty"` One won't
be able to call that method anymore because the object's own property hides the method
value.

Can you think of a way to call `hasOwnProperty` on an object that has its own 
property by that name?
