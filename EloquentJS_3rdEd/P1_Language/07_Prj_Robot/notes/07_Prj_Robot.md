# C7: PROJECT: A ROBOT

"[...] the question of whether Machines Can Think [...] is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim." --Edsger Dijkstra, _The Threats to Computing Science_.

In "project" chapters, teach'll stop pummeling one with new theory for a brief moement, and instead we'll work thorugh a program together. Theory is necessary to learn to program, but reading and undertanding acual programs is just as important.

Our project in this chapter is to build an automaton, a little programt that performs a task
in a virtual world. Our automaton will be a mail-delivery robot picking up and dropping off
parcels.
