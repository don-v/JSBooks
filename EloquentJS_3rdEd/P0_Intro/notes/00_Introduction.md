# INTRODUCTION

This book is about instructing computers and making them do 
what one wants is not always easy!

If one needs to send email or use a calculator, one can 
open an email client application or calculator application,
respectively, to accomplish those tasks. For unique open-ended
tasks, there probably is no application. 

_Programming_ is the act of constructing a _program_ -- a 
set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is 
fundamentally tedious and frustrating.
