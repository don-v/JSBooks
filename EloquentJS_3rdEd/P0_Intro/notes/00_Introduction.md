# INTRODUCTION

This book is about instructing computers and making them do 
what one wants is not always easy!

If one needs to send email or use a calculator, one can 
open an email client application or calculator application,
respectively, to accomplish those tasks. For unique open-ended
tasks, there probably is no application. 

_Programming_ is the act of constructing a _program_ -- a 
set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is 
fundamentally tedious and frustrating.

Program can be rewarding; it can allow one to do things in
seconds that would otherwise take _forever_ by hand. It is
a way to make one's computer  do things it couldn't do 
before. Provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.

Most programming is done with programming languages. A
_programming language_ is an artificially constructed
language used to instruct computers. Communicating with a
computer borrows heavily from human communication -- computer
languages allow words and phrases to be combined in new
ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.

1980s, 1990s, BASIC and DOS prompts were the main method of
interacting with computers. These have been replaced wiht 
visual interfaces which are easier to learn, but offer
less flexibility. Computer languages still exist, if one
knows where to look. JS is built in to every browser and
thus available on amost every device.

Goal of this book is to try to make one familiar enough 
with JS so that oen may do useful and amusing things with
it!

# ON PROGRAMMING

Teach will teach basic principles of programming alongside
JS. Programming based on simple and clear fundamental rules;
however, programs built upon these rules tend to become 
complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity.
One is building a maze, in a way, and one may get lost in it!

Strategy for learning programming:

> When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when 
>information grows unprotifatable, sleep.

-- Ursula K. Leguin, _The Left Hand of Darkness_

A program can be:

1. text typed by a programmer
2. the directing force that makes the computer do what it does
3. data in the computer's memory, that controls actions performed
on the same memory.

Program analagy with 'Machine': lots of separate parts tend to be 
involved, and to make the whole thing tick, we have to consider
the ways in which these parts interconnect and contriute to teh
operation of the whole!

A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these
immaterial machines!
