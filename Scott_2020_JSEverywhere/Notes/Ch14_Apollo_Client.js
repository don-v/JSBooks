// CHAPTER 14: WORKING IWTH APOLLO CLIENT

The modem-based connections for internet access from previous
decades, though quite slow and unreliable, still capture the 
essence of modern-day service communications:

1. services request a connection
2. make the connection
3. send a request
4. recieve the response

Our client application will work in a similar manner. We will
first make a connection to our server API application, and if
successful, make requests to that server.

In this chapter, we will use Apollo Client to connect to our
API. Once connected, we'll write a GraphQL query, which will be
used to display data on a page. We'll also introduce pagination, 
both within the API query and in our interface components!
