// CHAPTER 12: BUILDING A WEB CLIENT WITH REACT

The original idea behind hypertext was to take related documents and link
them together: if academic paper A references academic paper B let's make
it easy to click something and navigate between them. In 1989, a software 
engineer at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee had the idea to combine hypertext with 
networked computers, making it easy for someone to make these connections 
regardless of the locaiton of the documents. 

At its heart, the web remaines a medium for linking documents together. 
Each page is HTML, rendered in a web browser, with CSS  for styling and
JS for enhancements. Today, we use these technologies to build everything
from personal blogs and small brochure sites to complex interactive
applicaitons. the underlying advantage is that the web provides universal
access.  All anyone needs is a web browser on a web-connected device,
creating an inclusive-by-default environment.

// WHAT WE WILL BUILD WITH TEACH!

In the upcoming chapters we'll build the web client for our social
note application, Notedly. Users will be able to create and sign
in to an account, write notes in Markdown, edit their notes, view a
feed of other users' notes, and 'favorite' other users' notes. To
accomplish all of this, we will be interacting with out GraphQL
server API.

In our web application, users will be able to:

* create notes, as well as read, update, and delete notes they've created!

* view a feed...
