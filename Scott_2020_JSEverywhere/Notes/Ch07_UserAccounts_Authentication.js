// CHAPTER 7: USER ACCOUNTS AND AUTHENTICATION

We supply username and password -- submit the form to the 'receptionist'.
'recpetionist' then encrypts the password with a secret key and stores the 
encrypted version of the password in a locked file vault.

The 'receptionist' then stamps a coin, on which is pressed one's unique
membership ID. Upon returning to the front room, the 'receptionist'
hand you the coinc, which you tuck away in yoru pocket. Now each time
you return to the club, one only needs to show the coin to gain entrance!
