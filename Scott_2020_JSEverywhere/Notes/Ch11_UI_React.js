/* 
USER INTERFACES AND REACT

In this chapter, we explore we take a brief look at the
history of JS UI development. 

With that background, we then explore React, the
JS library we'll be using the rest of the way!

JS developed in mid-1990s (in 10 days, allegedly); JS provided
an embedded scripting language; allowed devs to add small
interactions to web page that were not possible with HTML
alone!

early, there were issues with cross-browser compatibility
which led to the proliferation of the dev of many browser-
specific libraries!

Mid-2000s, 'jQuery` and 'MooTools' took off; jQuery allowed
devs to write JS with a simple API that worked well across
browsers. Facilitated the ability to remove, add, replace, 
and animate things on web pages!

Around the same time, AJAX (asynchronous JS and XML) came 
on scene; AJAX allowed one to fetch data from a server and
inject it into the page. The combinations of these 2 
technologies provided an ecosystem to create powerful
interactive web applications!

As apps grew, so did need for organization and boilerplate
code! By early 2010s, frameworks like 'Backbone', 'Angular',
and 'Ember' dominated the JS application landscape.
