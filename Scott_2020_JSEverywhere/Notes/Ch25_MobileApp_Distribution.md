# CHAPTER 25: MOBILE APPLICATION DISTRIBUTION

In the old days, calculator game distribution occurred by transferring games
over a cord that physically connected two calculators, a source calculator
which had the game already loaded, and a destination calculator, to which
the game would be sent. This distribution method was slow, requiring two 
students to remain connected for several minutes while others waited. Today,
our digital pocket computers are capable of much more than old graphing
calcultors, in part, because one can easily extend their capabilities through
installable third-party applications.

With our initial application dev complete, we can now distribute our application 
so that others may accessi it. In this chapter, we learn to configure our `app.json`
file for distribution. We'll then publish our application publicly with 'Expo'. 
Finally, we generate application packages that can be submitted to the 'Apple' or
'Google Play' stores.

## `app.json` CONFIGURATION

'Expo' applications include an _app.json_ file, which is used to configure 
application-specific settings.

When we generate a new 'Expo' application, an _app.json_ file is automatically
created for us.
