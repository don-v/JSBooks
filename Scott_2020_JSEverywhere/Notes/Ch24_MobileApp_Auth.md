# CHAPTER 24: MOBILE APPLICATION AUTHENTICATION

Without the ability to customize or read user-specific data, 
out app might fill users with the same sense of discomfort. Their
notes are simply mixed in with those of everyone else, not making 
the application truly their own. In this chapter we'll add 
authentication to our application. To accomplish this, we'll 
introduce an authentication routing flow, store token data using
`Expo`'s `SecureStore`, create text forms in 'React Native', 
and perform authentication GraphQL mutations.
